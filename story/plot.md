- {{characters.prey.name}} stumbles across {{characters.pred.name}}
- {{characters.pred.name}} has a large belly; obviously full of Prey
- she informs him that he's only safe because she's still digesting someone _else_
> You're _actually_ pretty cute~\
> You know what?
>
> I'll make you a deal;
> If you come rub my belly until it's flat,
> I __won't__ eat you up
> _like the snack you are_~
